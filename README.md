This was going to be my final project for cs50.
I wanted to make a client/server application, the idea went through a lot of changing my mind until i settled on it being a mock platform for writers like a knockoff fiverr thing.
I eventually gave up and decided to call it quits after the third refactor leading nowhere and move on to something better before the sunken cost fallacy makes me waste another 2 months on this crap
